<h1>This is a Heading of my Day 2 Coding</h1>
<p>         This is a paragraph.
            How to writeacod in Github.GitHub repositories store a variety of projects. In this guide, you'll create a repository and commit your first change.        </p>
<p>          In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to create a local clone of your new project.
             To create a repository for your project, use the gh repo create subcommand. When prompted, select Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch and enter the name of your new project. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of to your personal account, specify the organization name and project name with organization-name/project-name.
Follow the interactive prompts. To clone the repository locally, confirm yes when asked if you would like to clone the remote project directory.
Alternatively, to skip the prompts supply the repository name and a visibility flag (--public, --private, or --internal). For example, gh repo create project-name --public. To clone the repository locally, pass the --clone flag. For more information about possible arguments, see the GitHub CLI manual.                        </p>

            How to writeacod in Github.GitHub repositories store a variety of projects. In this guide, you'll create a repository and commit your first change.        </p>
<p>          In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to create a local clone of your new project.
             To create a repository for your project, use the gh repo create subcommand. When prompted, select Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch and enter the name of your new project. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of to your personal account, specify the organization name and project name with organization-name/project-name.
Follow the interactive prompts. To clone the repository locally, confirm yes when asked if you would like to clone the remote project directory.
Alternatively, to skip the prompts supply the repository name and a visibility flag (--public, --private, or --internal). For example, gh repo create project-name --public. To clone the repository locally, pass the --clone flag. For more information about possible arguments, see the GitHub CLI manual.                        </p>

<P> GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
Collaborative working, one of GitHubâ€™s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built. </P>
